\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame}. Table containing the camera-trap records.}

\item{station_field}{\code{character}. Name of the column in \code{data} that uniquely
identifies each camera station. If set to \code{NULL}, all records are assumed to
originate from a single station.}

\item{species_col}{\code{character}. Name of the column containing the species
identifier. If \code{NULL}, all records are assumed to belong to the same species.}

\item{date_field}{\code{character}. Name of the column containing the \strong{date} of
each record. If set to \code{NULL}, all records are assumed to occur on the same day.}

\item{date_format}{\code{character}. Date format of the values in \code{date_field}.
The default is \code{"\%d/\%m/\%Y"}, where \verb{\%d} = day, \verb{\%m} = month, and \verb{\%Y} = year,
separated by \code{"/"}. Adjust this format according to your dataset.

Examples:
\code{"02/23/2023"} → \code{"\%m/\%d/\%Y"}
\code{"02-23-2023"} → \code{"\%m-\%d-\%Y"}}

\item{time_field}{\code{character}. Name of the column containing the \strong{time} of
each record. The expected format is always \code{"\%H:\%M:\%S"} (Hour:Minute:Second).}

\item{tz}{\code{character}. Time zone used when parsing date–time values. The
default is \code{"UTC"}, although other time zones may be specified depending on
the study region.}

\item{species_filter}{\code{character}. Optional species name used to filter
the dataset (e.g., \code{"Odocoileus virginianus"}). If \code{NULL}, all species are included.}

\item{lat}{\code{character}. Name of the column containing the latitude for each
record or station.}

\item{long}{\code{character}. Name of the column containing the longitude for each
record or station.}

\item{alpha}{\code{numeric}. Spatial scale parameter controlling the ease of
movement between cameras (spatial smoothing or movement scale, typically in meters).}

\item{alpha_sensitivity}{\code{numeric} or \code{NULL}. Optional vector of alternative
\code{alpha} values used to perform a sensitivity analysis of the MNI estimator to
changes in spatial scale. For each value in \code{alpha_sensitivity}, the function
recomputes MNI internally and produces diagnostic plots showing how MNI varies
with \code{alpha}. When this argument is not \code{NULL}, the plots also highlight the
\code{max_change_point} and \code{saturation_point} along the MNI–\code{alpha} curve.}

\item{dt}{\code{numeric}. Time-step size of the model, expressed in hours
(e.g., \code{1} for 1-hour steps).}

\item{min_prob}{\code{numeric}. Minimum probability threshold used to determine
whether a new detection is assigned to an existing individual or triggers
the creation of a new individual.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{data_with_ids}: a \code{data.frame} with the original records plus three
additional columns: \code{indiv_id} (assigned individual identifier),
\code{prob_last_ind} (probability of assignment to the selected existing individual),
and \code{prob_new_ind} (complementary probability of creating a new individual).

\item \code{MNI}: a \code{data.frame} summarizing the estimated Minimum Number of
Individuals for the focal species, including the columns \code{species}, \code{MNI},
\code{alpha}, \code{dt}, and \code{min_prob}.
}

When \code{alpha_sensitivity} is not \code{NULL}, the function also performs a sensitivity
analysis of MNI across the supplied \code{alpha} values and generates a diagnostic
plot. In this plot:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{max_change_point} marks the range of \code{alpha} where the MNI
estimator is most sensitive to changes in spatial scale (i.e., where the
structure of the data “breaks” the most).

\item The \strong{saturation_point} marks a value of \code{alpha} beyond which
increasing \code{alpha} produces only small changes in MNI, indicating that the
curve is approaching a plateau. From this point onward, the assumed
connectivity is so high that most detections tend to be treated as distinct
individuals.

\description{
\code{assign_MNI_hmm()} estimates the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) from
camera-trap detections using a discrete-time, discrete-space \strong{Markov
movement model}. Camera stations are treated as spatial states, and movement
probabilities are defined by a distance-based transition matrix controlled by
the spatial scale parameter \code{alpha}. Temporal separation between detections is
incorporated through the k-step transition matrix (\code{T^k}), providing a
space–time probability of moving between stations.
}
\details{
Each new detection is assigned to the existing individual with the highest
transition-based probability, provided it exceeds \code{min_prob}; otherwise, a new
individual is created. The number of unique assigned IDs yields the \strong{MNI}.

Optionally, the function can evaluate a vector of \code{alpha} values
(\code{alpha_sensitivity}) and return MNI estimates and diagnostic plots to assess
sensitivity and saturation with respect to the movement scale.

\strong{Movement model and transition probabilities}

The function relies on a discrete-space, discrete-time \strong{Markov movement
model}. Each camera station is treated as a state, and movement among
stations is governed by a spatial transition matrix derived from pairwise
distances. A commonly used spatial kernel is:

\deqn{P_{\text{esp}}(d_{ij}) = \exp\left(-\frac{d_{ij}}{\alpha}\right)}

where \eqn{d_{ij}} is the distance between stations \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}, and
\eqn{\alpha} controls the decay rate of movement probability with distance.
After applying the kernel, rows are normalized to obtain a valid
\strong{one-step transition matrix} \eqn{T}.

Temporal separation between detections is incorporated under the Markov
assumption: if two detections are separated by \eqn{k} time-steps of length
\code{dt}, the relevant transition probability is obtained from the
\emph{k-step transition matrix}:

\deqn{(T^k)_{ij} = P(S_{t+k} = j \mid S_t = i)}

which provides the joint \strong{space–time probability} of an individual moving
from the station of its previous detection (\eqn{i}) to the station of the
current detection (\eqn{j}) after \eqn{k} time steps.

For comparison, the simpler separable model uses independent spatial and
temporal decay terms:

\deqn{P_{\text{temp}}(\Delta t) = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta t}{\beta}\right)}
\deqn{P = P_{\text{esp}}(d_{ij}) \times P_{\text{temp}}(\Delta t)}

but the Markov formulation implemented here uses \eqn{T^k} directly, which
naturally integrates both distance and time.

\strong{Individual assignment rule}

For each new detection, the probability that it belongs to an existing
individual is extracted from the corresponding entry of \eqn{T^k}. If the
maximum probability across all candidates is below \code{min_prob}, the
detection initializes a new individual; otherwise, it is assigned to the most
probable existing individual. The final number of individual IDs equals the
estimated \strong{Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI)}
